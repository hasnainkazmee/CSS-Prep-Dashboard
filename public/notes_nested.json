He found that fainter, more distant galaxies showed a larger degree of red shift; closer galaxies, not so much. Hubble determined that this was because the universe itself is expanding. - Wherever there is empty spaces in the universe, more is forming every second. So, dark energy is some kind of energy intrinsic to empty spaces. - Features of Dark Energy - It makes up approximately 68% of the universe and appears to be associated with the vacuum in space. - It is evenly distributed throughout the universe. - Even distribution means that dark energy does not have local gravitational effect, but rather a global effect on the universe. This leads to repulsive force, which tends to accelerate the expansion."

The rising warm air then comes in contact with east flowing jet stream where it splits i.e. one goes east and other goes west. The cold air stream that comes from the pole, they flow towards the southeastern direction. Cold air is dense, hence it stick to the ground and tries to catch it back. So the flow become anti - clockwise circulation. Above the cold air there is another belt of cold dry air that comes from the pole which descends in the upper atmosphere and fills up the middle region of the cold surface air and warm rising air. - At the top warm air climbs over the cold air and series of cumulus cloud appears over the sky and cause rainfall. - When cold air overtakes warm air the cyclone disappears."

These are specially powerful, towering thunderstorms called supercells. Reaching up to over 50,000, they bring high force winds, giant hailstones, sometimes flooding and great flashes of lightening too. These are the type of storm that breeds tornados. - Rising air - Any storm is from when condensation occurs, the byproducts of the clouds formation. Condensation releases heat, and heat becomes the energy that drives huge upward drafts of air. More condensation means bigger clouds. - In supercells, this rising air - mass is particularly strong. As the air climbs, it can change direction and start to move more quickly. - Finally at a storm base there a lot of moisture. - When all these things are in place, a vortex can develop enclosed by the storm, forming a wide tall tube of spinning air that then gets pulled upward"

Turning Physics into Engineering was easy on paper, but hard in real life. But, there were many people who didn\u2019t just want to abandon the promise of the atomic age; an exciting new technology; the prospect of enormously cheap electricity and the prospect of being independent of oil and gas imports.

If the vaccinated person then comes into contact with the disease itself, their immune system will recognize it and immediately produce the antibodies they need to fight. - Delivery system - There are several new delivery systems in development in the hope of making vaccines more efficient to deliver. The latest development in vaccine delivery technologies have resulted in oral vaccines. - Objective - In 1885, Louis Pasture created the first successful vaccine against rabies for young boy who has been bitten 14 times by a rabid dog."
